# Hello---World
Hey! New to Github. Just trying to figure it all out.

So, let me tell you a little about myself...
I am currently pursuing my master's degree in health administration.  At first, I kinda wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my degree. Just knew I wanted to help people and make a difference in peoples lives.  Anyways, I am a huge gamer and after attempting to make my own video game  my interest in coding, data science, data analysis took off.  So I took some coding courses, bought some books and dabbled in some programming languages like JavaScript and SQL. It was a struggle and still is but when things click it is an unbelievably rewarding experience.  

Lately, I've been putting more time in learning SQL because it is more relavent language to know for my career. In addition to my graduate school work, I am in the middle of taking some data science and data analysis courses online. R was a language or tool that I am required to learn to use, along with Git, and Github. So, yea that's where I am at.  Hopefully, I can work on some projects regarding healthcare in the future.
